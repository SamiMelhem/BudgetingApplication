# Budgeting Application

## Overview
A comprehensive tool designed to help individuals manage their personal finances. It offers an intuitive interface for tracking income and expenses, visualizing financial trends, and setting and achieving financial goals. It combines financial planning with self-improvement recommendations, creating a holsitic approach to achieving one's goals.

This project is the result of me combining my skills of creating user-friendly pages, python backend projects, and applying my learning of SQL and PostgreSQL to a project that needs to retrieve from a database.
